# covid19-dashboard-france

:date: Creation date: November 2020

## :male_detective:	Description

The aim of the project was to create a python dashboard about an actual subject. Obviously I chose to work on the datavisualisation of coronavirus in France.
We can find information about tested people, confirmed cases and deaths in the country and more precisely for each french department.
It results with a web application deploy on Heroku.
